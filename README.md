Inspired by the famous netflix series squid games, This project is designed to show the concept of the RED LIGHT GREEN LIGHT GAME.

Using Arduino uno pins, sensors such as ultasonic sensors and actuators like servo motor, Buzzer and LED's, I create a game that shows the 
concept of the game and plot. When the red light is blinked the player should not move the object from the spot and when the Green Light is turned on 
the players can move the object. 

 The code was edited on arduino editor and commited to arduino board.
